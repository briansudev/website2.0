								<p> For some time now, I have always wanted to start my own blog. I draw my inspiration from a <a href="http://jamesmaa.com">blog</a> I started following recently. In James's blog, he lists several reasons why he started his own blog and mine are similar:
									<ul>
										<li>To keep a record of the things I do during college</li>
										<li>To reflect upon how I develop as a person and as a friend to others <i>(Somewhat similar to the first reason)</i></li>
										<li>To improve my writing</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p> Much of the content here will contain personal information. But, I will not disclose information that should be kept private. I'll keep that to myself. In the entries below, you will not learn much about the intimate details of my life. Nor should you find anything inappropriate - I don't think I do anything reckless. Instead, you might encounter a log of what I've done that day. My friends have said that reading my initial entries resembles reading a diary without the appropriateness of doing so. Perhaps, you will realize the same feeling. Anyways, feel free to read the articles below. I hope that what you read below will match how you find me in person! </p>

								<p> I'd like to say that college has transformed what I think about tests. Perhaps, this only applies to technical classes. On Wednesday, I received my Math 54 midterm back with a score of 78/100. The average was a 66/100 and the standard deviation was 13. I was quite pleased with this result, but a little disappointed that the question I lost 20 points on turned out to be less complicated than I imagined it. Oh well, glad my 14 hours of studying paid off. </p>
								<p> On Thursday, I started proj2 for CS61B. Working with the skeleton code was pretty intutive, besides being clueless on how to parse the inputted text. I was pretty pleased with my efforts after 6 hours of coding. I think it's coming along nicely -- hopefully this wouldn't take 50 hours like the previous project! </p>
								<p> This morning, I calculated that each class session cost me about $40. It was a really rough estimate and the actual number is lower, but I hope this is enough to motivate me to go to class each day starting next week. (Kinda the worst week to start this routine: research paper proposal due Tue, 2 midterms + 1 math quiz on Wed, CWR4B presentation on Thur, proj2 due Fri.) I've heard that once you realized how much each class "costs", you're less likely to miss class. Maybe, this will work! </p>

								<p> Work, work, work. For the past several days, I had been hard at work studying for Math 54 and working on my English paper. In total, I studied for about 14 hours for my math midterm on Monday. Surprisingly, Professor Grunbaum decided to reuse two problems from one of his previous midterms. The other problem, however, had a part that was difficult. I thought I almost had it at the very end, then I realized I didn't orthogonally diagonalize the matrix. I think I was very close.</p>
								<p>Monday night, because I chose to spend the weekend studying, was an all nighter for me. I struggled throughout the night to churn out my CWR4B. During the night, I would often get distracted and lose myself on Reddit, YouTube, and Facebook. These moments happened the most when I would reach a writer's block and struggled to churn out an argument. Overall, by 8am in the morning, I was pretty satisfied with my paper. In the evening, Andrew, my roommate, and I horsed around in the hallway as I messed with him by refusing to open our dorm door for him. He ended up whacking me in the head with my metal water bottle as I tried to push him away. Now, I have a big lump on my head. It's not painful, it's just ugly. </p>

								<p>Today, I attended my Math 54 lecture for the first time in weeks. It was a review session and I was hoping to catch if any specific material was on or not on the test. Nothing of that sort emerged, but I did gain a quick review of some concepts. Looks like I have a lot to study.</p>
								<p>Fortunately, also a first in a while, I received a full score on my math quiz. Hopefully, that's a good sign. My answers to some of the answers on the quiz were pretty funny. Because I didn't know the names of some theorems, I wrote on my paper "by that theorem... blah blah blah." No complaints!</p>
								<p>In Hilfinger's lecture today about sorting, I fell asleep for a good 20 minutes. Nothing more occured from there.</p>
								<p>In the evening, I headed over to Martinez to work with Andy, Hnin, and Namrata on the lab. Unfortunately, none of us had finished the lab, which prevented us from starting on the project. After a decent 4 hours or so of working, they and several of their friends went with me to Late Night. I got another omelette, my fourth in three days.</p>

								<p> Well, today was Halloween. Aside for the far more than usual candy crunching - I usually eschew eating candy, today was no different than many other days. Before attending CWR4B, I watched part of <i>Transformers</i> and then worked on my paper, which my professor graciously allowed me to turn in next Tuesday. I also went to the Enactus dinner at Indian Flavors Express - the food was ok. In the evening, I found books on data structures I figured would be helpful for CS61B. I also attempted to read some CS books to catch up on material learned in class. It wasn't a bad effort. I also got two delicious omelettes from late night today. I brought my <i>Head First Java</i> to read while I waited there, but several Crossroads staff were puzzled why I was studying on Halloween. Apparently, studying on Halloween is weird. Anyways, I added my class projects to my projects page to beef it up a little. Now, I'm off to sleep!</p>

								<p> Nothing really happened today. Took my math quiz - I think I did well on that. Tried to follow along in Hilfinger's lecture, but, like always, I never really do. IEOR seminar was slightly interesting - it was about cloud robotics. I already had listened to Professor Goldberg's TED talk about the subject. Collected draft from Professor Crisp's box with her comments. Ate dinner with Alyson, Brittany, Manpreet, Mitchell, and Brandon. Went to PiE and didn't get much stuff again. Rushed to the haywire on the CS hw. Got an omelette from late night. Watched <i>Black Hawk Down</i>. All in all a typical day. </p>

								<p> So, I haven't blogged in a while. Last Tuesday, following my CWR4B class, I caught a cold, which later turned out to be an upper respiratory infection - I went to Tang Center on Monday for the first time. This sickiness has basically defined my past week. During the first part of the sickiness, I had pretty painful headache, sore throat, feebleness, and running nose. Now, the sickiness still persists and is still annoying as ever. My incessant coughing makes concentrating extremely painful. It's a virus so I can't really do anything about it besides taking symptom relievers. I'll try my best to tough it out, but it's making me fall behind in many of my classes. </p>
								<p> Other than that, my past week has been the typical. This weekend, I returned home and received my new Macbook Pro Retina with an Intel Haswell processor. I love it - it's so fast, smooth, and crisp compared to my previous $300 budget laptop. I love this baby. </p>
								<p> I'll start resuming daily blogs tomorrow. Hopefully, I have a speedy recovery. </p>

								<p> Vaishal once told me that there were many days in which he spent his nights at the Hackerspace in Cory Hall. Having seen the sun rise many times over the past few days, the maxim appears true: "You can measure how long a CS project takes you by how many sunrises you've seen." During the past three days, I've spent countless hours working on my CS61B project in Soda Hall, Martinez Commons, and in my room. Over the course of the project, I've worked with countless people - Maryam, Tobin, Nabil, Jesus, Vincent, Brendea, Nicole, Kenny, Andy, Hnin, Namrata, Olivia, Elizabeth, Bao, and more. I've rattled my head against my desk, computer, and wall. I've swiggled strings of code on whiteboards, windows, and paper. I've explained my code to numerous ears. I've seen far too many Piazza posts. I've debugged null pointer exceptions, infinite loops, and strange text. I've drank more than 10 cartons of chocolate milk and eaten too much ramen. I've opened my cheerios box at midnight, poured it into a tin bowl, and saw it vanish by sunrise. I've jousted with the autograder, fixing bugs and encountering new ones. I've discovered inconsistencies in the skeleton code and wtf'ed. I've rewrote methods over and over again until one finally works. And, after countless failures, I've finally succeeded. I feel accomplished. </p>

								<p> After sleeping so late, I woke up around noon. I ended missing my math lecture and discussion, but I still attended my CS61B lecture. After lecture, I installed a Windows 8 virtual machine onto my roommate's computer so that I could install my printer's only-windows-compatible drivers. That didn't work for some reason... </p>
								<p> Jeff, whom I met two weeks ago when Victor showed me around his lab, invited me to have dinner with his Christian fellowship today. They seem like really nice people. And, funny too. At the beginning of Bible Study, the minister Eugene did this extremely fun and suspenseful activity where the objective was to say a number in order without anyone else saying it. For example, if two people said "4!" at the same time, they both would be eliminated. I was the only one who said 29 - didn't get eliminated! </p>
								<p> I left early to work on the project with Andy, Kenny, Nicole, and Hnin. I actually managed to get a decent amount of work done this session. After a Crossroads omelete, that is. They are sooooo gooood. Yesterday, I had my roommate buy one for me from Late Night. Today, I ate two more! In my opinion, it's the best food at Crossroads! Watch all my meal points go away... </p>

								<p> Today, during office hours, I found myself bombarded with questions about the Ants project. One asked me what exactly was a Place in relation to the project - I ended up explaining to him that he could think of an apartment block with each residence being a Place. I hoped I explained it to him well. Other people had questions about Hungry Ant. Some had ants that weren't digesting the bees. Yes, it's such a cute and fun project - it was my favorite out of the four I did in CS61A. During the last 30 minutes of my office hours, I was the only staff member there, so I found everyone chasing after me to ask questions. Though it was rather hectic, it was also fun trying to quickly read and understand code and debug other people's problems. </p>
								<p> After CWR4B and an Enactus meeting, I headed over to Soda Hall to work on the CS61B project with Nicole. While there, a company named Addepar was hosting an information session with pizza and free stuff. I grabbed a T-shirt and Beanie - finally got a shirt that fit my size from a tech company! Several hours later, Nicole and I headed to Martinez to continue working on the project with Kenny, Andy, and Hnin. She drove us there in a "Beemer," which I discovered was short for a BMW. Didn't know that. </p>
								<p> I didn't do much while over at Martinez. Earlier in the morning, I tried to install Ubuntu 13.10 on to my computer - it had just released. During the process, like it did during the summer, it corrupted my computer and therefore I needed to boot my computer from a USB. I asked Kenny to use his computer - he refused, afraid that I might do something bad to his computer. Clearly, he's not a computer scientist. My floormate Matt also refused for the same reason. I ended up calling Jessica and asking her if I could use her computer to make a Bootable USB, which she said was ok. I spent an hour at her place making the USB and talking to her. Once I returned to Martinez - my friends there thought the admin detained me for corrupting the residence computers - I spent the rest of my time tweaking my new OS. It's much faster now - which is great, considering I have a pretty bad low budget laptop. </p>
								<p> I ended up sleeping at 6:30am that night. After I returned to my dorm, I spent the wee early morning hours of the day reading the specs. The whole program makes so much sense to me now after making the effort to understand how it works out! I got to see the sunrise, too. I don't think it's a good thing though... </p>

								<p> These past few days have been extremely hectic and busy for me. Today, Wednesday, I had a CS61B midterm that I spent the past few days studying for. All that effort, however, proved to be fruitless as I was stumped by the questions on the test. On hindsight, the problems weren't really that difficult - I had all the resources available to me. The only problem was that the time constraint greatly limited what I could actually do. Specifically, I chose to spend a great deal on time on one problem about IntList, believing that my experience with IntList could allow me to solve the problem relatively quickly, but I ended up not solving the problem and taking a great deal of time out of the 50 minutes exam time. Well, before the test while I was waiting outside, I told Brendea, "Today, blood will be spilled and heroes will be discovered." I guess that's not today -- I've fallen.. I think. I'll pick myself back up though. </p>
								<p> Nothing much happened the past few days. I've noticed that my dorm room, ever since I started cramming for Hilfinger, has been getting significantly messier. From the weekend's laundry, I still had not put my sheet on my bed. Vacumming -- nope. Haven't done my weekly vacuumming in a while. Well, I tried to fix that today, by tidying my room. I'll vacuum soon - I promise! </p>

								<p> In anticipation of taking Charlene around San Francisco and Berkeley today, I <i> tried </i> to wake up at 7:45am to get stuff done. But, when the alarm rang, I hit the snooze alarm and the next thing I know - it's 8:15. It took more than 15 minutes after that for me to pull myself out of bed and do my morning routine. Except, today, I chose not to shower in the morning. (I do shower at night everyday already.) </p>
								<p> For breakfast, I went down to Crossroads with Brittney. There, they had delicious country-style steak, crepes, gravy on a biscuit, and eggs. It was particularly filling. Brittney also taught me Alyson's oatmeal and granola recipe - oatmeal + granola cereal + milk = deliciousness! </p>
								<p> By the time I returned to my dorm, it was almost time to head to San Francisco to pick up Charlene. Before I left, though, I put my laundry in the washing machine and then the dryer. </p>
								<p> I hadn't left Berkeley in a while, so it was nice leaving it for a change. As I left, I saw staff set up for an event that later turned out to be a little festival. I don't know how to best describe it. All the streets were closed too. </p>
								<p> I rode BART and got off at Powell Street station and headed north on Powell St. to pick Charlene up from Cartwright Hotel. There, I met her friend Alaina and the three of us went to Union Square for some quick pictures. After that and Alaina's departure, we, the two of us, headed to BART to return to Berkeley. I showed Charlene around some of Bekreley's attractions, such as the dinosauars in VLSB, the sound-reflector thingy in front of VLSB facing north, and the whispeirng bench. I also met some of her plethora of guy friends, Kalan and Kyle, and showed her my room, which she commented was rather small. Rich private school fellows -.-. </p>
								<p> Soon after, I had to take her back to San Francisco and so it was just us two again. I met her parents at Powell St station and told them that Berkeley is not as bad as people say it is. People aren't really competitive in Berkeley, at least within the CS classes that I've taken here, my floormates don't party a lot, the bathrooms are clean, and that everyone here is so nice. Charlene probably made the wrong choice to attend USC. =D. </p>
								<p> After I returned to Berkeley, Kenny told me that he, Vincent, Brendea, and Andy were heading to Soda to print what Andy called "care packages." Basically, Hilfinger's test is open every non-inanimate objects such as electronic devices, so they wanted to go print a ton of stuff from printer. We had difficulty finding a working printer and ended up stealing paper from the printer in 330 and using it in the 274 printer. I also explained to Andy VATSIM, the virtual air traffic simulation network. </p>
								<p> Andy, Kenny, and I got dinner at Crossroads after we left. Following a 20 minute nap back in my dorm, I headed back to Martinez to work on the project with Brandea, Kenny, Nicole, Andy, Namrata, Hnin, and Vincent. We actually got a lot done, thanks to Brendea being so far ahead on the project. I ended up leaving Martinez at around 1am. It was quite late. </p>
								<p> I just folded the laundry from earlier in the day. Except, I don't feel like putting the sheets on my bed. Too much work at 4am. Anyways, I'll just sleep on the top of my sheets with my blanket covering me. </p>

								<p> Throughout the course of today, I started to feel time and pressure constraining on me. With the CS61B project and midterm closing in fast on me, I've become very nervous as to what will happen the next week. Tomorrow, I have to take my friend Charlene around San Francisco and Berkeley. Currently, I'm trying to squeeze that into my schedule. </p>
								<p> I woke up at 11:30 today and decided to grab lunch at Crossroads by myself. After, I headed to O'Brien hall for PiE. Originally, I had intended to stay only for an hour, but I ended up paying attention to the git tutorial session Nikita hosted. Also, Daniel gave me our first concrete assignment. Simply put, the assignment was to change a byte array of size 8 into something like a Hash Map. Originally, the packet sent to the receiver on the robot contained a byte array that contained information pertinent to the robot's function. How it was accessed was through indexing. The first seven elements of the array were used in their entirety, meaning that each byte was read in whole, but, for the eigth element, the byte was broken down into 8 different bits. Hence, we would have create something like a dictionary containing fifteen keys and their values. Doesn't sound too difficult. </p>
								<p> After PiE, I headed with Tobin to the HKN CS61B review session. They covered a lot of material relatively quickly, so, I only have a little better grasp of the course materials. Well, definitely gotta study for that class. Once the review session finished, I headed to Crossroads, where I got a takeout box and cup. The chicken they had today was so tender, juicy, and delicious. One of the best! Following dinner in my dorm, I made my way to Soda Hall, where I worked with Tobin's friends Kimberly, Maryam, and, later, Nabil. I managed to retrieve the token groups in the InputParser in the approximately five hours I spent in the lab. Also, Tobin, Maryam, and Kimberly explained to me what each class in the skeleton code does - or, at least, tried to. It was pretty helpful. </p>
								<p> I met Kenny, Vincent, Namrata, Hnin, and Andy in Asian Ghetto after I left Soda. I was up for a second dinner, so I got Pad Thai from Thai Basil. I returned to my dorm. Should I study now? Or work on the project? Anyways, I'm short on time! </p>

								<p> Somehow, I managed to sleep until 12 today. Last night was a total blur. I completely forgot what happened last night. No, I didn't get drunk or anything - in fact, I've never drank in my life. Must not have been a hangover. I was probably just exhausted. All I do remember is that I was on my bed at around 4 am and at 6:30 am I woke up and saw my roommate Andrew working on his desk. At that time, I went to the bathroom, came back, and slept once more. </p> 
								<p> Fortunately, or, unfortunately, depending on the circumstances, there is the history feature on any web browser that tells you what you were browsing at a certain hour, unless, that is, you cleared it to hide all the bad stuff. Mine showed that, last night, I played a lot of bullet chess, which I now remembered that I lost a lot, and also that I was on Reddit reading AskReddit articles. I was also listening to the Steward of Gondor theme a lot - now I remember that I was trying to learn how to play it on my iPad. </p>
								<p> Anyways, I didn't attend math lecture today - obviously, since I had just woken up, dazed. I did my normal routine of 40 decline push-ups, which I'm still surprised that I managed to keep doing it everyday for the past couple of weeks. After that, I attended my math discussion, in which I received my quiz I took on Wednesday - I received a perfect score, yay! First in a long time. I also was clueless throughout most of the discussion, I didn't keep to my commitment of doing the next section's homework before the section was introduced in lecture. But, turns out that all I had to really know was this simple formula to calculate the projection of y onto a subspace W. With that formula, I readily solved all the problems in the discussion without even knowing much about what I was doing. Magic formulas, they call it, right? </p>
								<p> After discussion, I decided to eat at Thai Noodle 2, this time by myself. It was actually quite lonely, but, for company, I decided to read the specifications for my CS61B project. I ordered Thai Boat Noodle with egg noodles instead of vermicilli, which I had ordered when I ate here with Patrick last weekend. After eating the dish, I realized that I preferred vermicilli over egg noodles, even though when I had it, I thought I would like egg noodles better. </p>
								<p> I attended Hilfinger's lecture again, even though I barely got anything out of it. I helped some of my friends in CS61B with the lab during the lecture. Turns out, we can actually submit the lab now. But, I tried my best to follow the slides - I even had them printed out in front of me. It slightly helped, and I was less clueless than usual, but still. </p>
								<p> After lecture, I returned to my dorm. Matt, Patrick, AD, and I decided to play brawl, which we hadn't played in over a week since Patrick was pretty much sick during the entire week. Well, I sucked. After brawl, Alyson, Brittney, AD, Sid, Patrick, and I headed down to Crossroads to eat dinner. I tried to invite Kelly and Jennifer to eat with us, but turns out 7th floor had their own little thing. But, Crossroads was ok - they had "Pad Thai Noodle" which was really just egg noodles. Strange how I had Thai food earlier. They also had a green tea dessert, the exact name of which I couldn't pronounce. </p>
								<p> After dinner, I went with Brittney to the Main Stacks to do some little Friday night studying. There, I met Brittney's friend Kelly, another one, and her friend Kelvin. I think that's his name. During the session, I managed to finish a section of Math and ended up with two more problems remaining for the next section. When all four of us left the library, we discovered that it was absolutely freezing outside. It was sooo cold. Anyways, I took Brittney to Martinez and Kenny signed us in. She chose to leave instead of staying in the third floor lounge because Kenny was watching a company he worked for on a show called <i> Shark Tank</i>. During my hour and a half at Martinez, I managed to finish the rest of the Math homework and also read the specification for the project again. Andy also showed us this thing called whitepages. Turns out, you can find where someone lives just by searching a name. Now, that's kinda creepy. </p>
								<p> When I returned, I saw members of the seventh floor playing brawl in Patrick's room. Albany, Steven, a fourth year, Kelly, and her roommate, Andrea, were there playing Super Smash Brothers Brawl. Andrew, when I walked into my room, asked if I wanted to see Hounds of Baskerville, another BBC Sherlock episode. I didn't really want to see the episode again, so I asked if Patrick wanted to watch. He replied in the negative, so I asked Kelly if she wanted to watch it. Turns out she has never seen BBC Sherlock before, so I invited her and Andrea to watch the first episode in my room, after they were hesistant about watching it in the laundry room. It turns out that they really enjoyed watching Sherlock. That was good. I felt like they were locked into the intensity and epicness of the show. I also showed Gabe around our room before we watched the episode. Anyways, I really should start on the project tomorrow, attend the review session hosted by HKN, and read my books I just bought this week. So much things to do, AAANDDDD, it's 4:30am as of this writing. </p>

								<p> Again, I chose not to attend my CS61B lab in the morning and work on my CWR4B essay that I thought we had to work on for the class. Turns out, that wasn't necessary. Well, oops. </p>
								<p> Yesterday, I had invited Kelly and Jennifer to attend my office hours. I was pretty delighted when I saw that they both came. I ended up helping out them and several others on the Trends project that was due tonight. Whenever a project is due, OH becomes a little more fun! I really enjoy helping people and watching them exclaim with delight after they solved the problem. I feel like an integral part of the process. </p>
								<p> After CWR4B, I returned to my dorm for a shortwhile and then left to eat an early dinner at Crossroads by myself. Sometimes, a period of solitude allows me to recuperate after a trying day. Things often happen too fast and, occasionally, I need to recollect myself. After a short 15 minute meal at Crossroads, I headed over to Soda Hall. </p>
								<p> I managed to finish the lab in my 2 hours and 30 minutes there. At the beginning, I felt lost, completely clueless as to how to approach the problem. But, then I started asking the substitude GSI questions. Apparently, the regular GSI for that session had a midterm. In total, I asked about 20-25 questions and, at the end, I gained a better understanding of interfaces and abstract classes in java. I also met a classmate from my summer CS61A class, Jesus. He gave me some tips on how to start the project, which I hope to bunker down in my room and work on this weekend. </p>
								<p> After I finished the lab, I learned that Kelly and Jennifer had issues with their Trends project. So, I headed back. Since our laundry room was commandeered by AD, Brittney, Nitasha, and others, I ended up working with them in the seventh floor hallway, where I met other seventh floor residents. I still prefer the eighth floor, though. Perhaps, it's because I'm more familiar with the people up here. The seventh floor people remarked that we gave them weird looks when they came up here. Probably, because we give the boyfriends of the girls on our floors weird looks, too. Anyways, once I returned back to my dorm after successfully helping them with the project and teaching Kelly a little Unix, I returned to my dorm. Hopefully, I will see them again before the day their next project is due. I tried learning the Gondor Theme from Lord of the Rings on my iPad's piano app. However, I couldn't really coordinate my two hands really well. Looks like I should have learned how to play with I was young. Also, I ate ramen for the first time in three weeks. Lately, I think I've been staying healthy. Anyways, it's 3:30am again. Oops. </p>

								<p> This morning, I rushed to class to turn in my Insects Observation paper. For reasons unknown, I saw so many familiar faces on the way there. That was quite strange. I chose not to attend my Math 54 lecture after so that I could study for the quiz in my discussion in an hour. Before I went to the East Asian Library to study, however, I took Matthew to Gomnaru in the Northside Asian Ghetto to survey the korean food there. Having tried it once, I liked it enough to return. He said it was ok. </p>
								<p> After my math discussion and the quiz, which I think I did well on <em>, hopefully, fingers crossed </em>, I went to the startup fair. There, the first company I spoke to was rather skeptical of me, probably because I was a freshman and had little experience. But, hey, I have a lot of potential to learn right? I spoke with Cloudera and Flipboard representatives, from whom I learned about many technologies they use such as Hadoop and Amazon EC2's. I also received a 2XL T-shirt from Cloudera that says, "Data is the new bacon," a nice portfolio notebook, and a frisbee.</p>
								<p> In the evening, Brandon cooked some egg noodle and chinese sausage for Brittney, me, and himself. It was pretty good - it made both me and Brittney long for more Asian food. Later that evening, Patrick dragged me down to the bottom of Towle for a 7th-8th floor study session. However, I was the only representative from the 8th floor. There, I met some of the seventh floor people, including Nora, Kelly, and Jennifer. I was surprised by the number of CS majors on their floor - on ours, there is only one other person taking a CS class at the moment. Anyways, I helped Kelly and Jennifer with their Trends project due the next day, while working on my CS61B hw. </p>
								<p> Now, at 3:30am in the morning, I realized that our CWR4B teacher wanted us to work on the essay for today, since the group  presentation scheduled had members that were sick. So tired! </p>

								<p> Today, I missed my morning CS61B discussion and my CS61A OH and Lab to work on my essay for my CWR4B class. Due today was a draft of part of the essay. I ended up spending roughly 5 hours typing a draft, showing how civil disobedience was a concept that developed in the last couple of centuries and has influenced many movements since. I also typed my research proposal, which was an assignment due the week before. Somehow, I didn't see it on the agenda. Anyways, the professor didn't accept my proposal - I didn't list my sources. Turn it next time, she says. </p>
								<p> In the evening, I chose to attend a random CS61B discussion, since I missed my morning discussion. It was rather empty - there was only 10 of us, compared to a rather packed room of about 30 during my regular discussion section. This made things personal and allowed me to ask more questions than I usually would. Maybe I'll start attending this discussion from now on. </p>
								<p> I had dinner with my friend Eric from my high school days. Nothing much went on there. When I returned, I spent about 3 hours typing an essay about my beetle I observed for the Insect Observation project. Over the past months, working on CS has taught me to be as concise as possible. Hence, I found it difficult to meet the 500 word requirement. Or, perhaps, I had typed too much already today. After I finished that, I decided to prepare myself for war with CS61B. That is, I printed out all of the discussion sections practice problems, midterm review problems, one past Hilfinger midterm, and also bought <i> Head First Java </i> from Amazon. I found that when I try to read pdfs,  I always get distracted. $30 is worth it for an A, isn't it? Hopefully. </p>

								<p> After a mere 4 hours of sleep, I woke up to prepare for my insects midterm once more, eating Frosted Flakes while reading websites explaining the anatomy of insects. I ended up doing ok on the midterm. I couldn't get some questions - I guess my studying wasn't thorough enough. </p>
								<p> My lack of sleep caused me to nod on and off during my Math 54 and CS61B lectures today. It feels like the beginning of my restless nights. </p>
								<p> At 6, I went to Kersege to do the Facebook puzzle and met up with Daniel and his friends, Can and Cem, pronounced John and Jem. They're twins from Turkey and are really chill. After spending an hour reviewing our Python knowledge, we attempted the puzzle. For the first 10 minutes, I was extremely productive. But, when I didn't get the right answer, I kinda froze up and lost faith in my approach. So, I watched Daniel attempt the puzzle. 20 minutes later, I realized that I was super duper close - all I had to do was to sort the list of binary digits. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to sort the sequence in the remaining time. It was quite a letdown, realizing that I were so close but got sidetracked. </p>
								<p> After a quick and late dinner at Crossroads with the trio, I headed to Unit 1 to help Jessica with the next CS61A lab. I was surprised that many of the problems I struggled to do in CS61A came naturally to me when I attempted them. We ended up completing the entire lab - it took us about 3 hours. But yea, now, I have to write my essays for CWR4B. Ugh.. </p>

								<p> Yesterday was pretty uneventful. I did my math hw for the next lecture during the afternoon. </p>
								<p> At 5pm, Kenny invited me to go lifting with him. It felt weird to be in there and not know what to do. He showed me how to do squats, deadlifts, benchpress, army lifts? with barbells, curls, and much more. I couldn't get the form correct for many of the exercises. Maybe after a couple more rounds I'll start getting it right. </p>
								<p> My evening wasn't that exciting. I spent my wee hours of the night studying for my insects test. Andrew's friend Steve also came to visit while I was studying. He was particularly loud and annoying, blasting kpop music. </p>

								<p>Today, I woke up close to 12pm, which is sorta atypical of me. Perhaps, it's because of the absence of my roommate. Over lunch at Thai Noodle with my RA Patrick, I developed a theory that my roommate Andrew exerts a bad influence on me in a positive way. My logic was this: his sleeping at 4am, random sleeping habits, and his major LOL playing epitomizes the actions I need to do the opposite of. Therefore, when he's around, I sleep earlier, wake up earlier, eat reguarly, etc. I think that's how it works. </p>
								<p>After Thai Noodle, which, btw, was delicious, I attended my Pioneers in Engineering meeting, in which I just installed Visual Studio and Unity on my VM. Nothing special there. After I arrived back in my dorm, I elected to do my laundrry and chores, wiping the table tops, cleaning out the fridge, the shelves, windows, and sorting my papers. I really didn't feel like doing my CS61B hw at this point. I also got started on setting up a Web Server on my Raspberry Pi, but, as of this writing, I'm not very far into it. I did muster the motivation to do my CS61B hw after dinner at Crossroads with fellow floormates, though. It took several hours and was about Java's Regular Expressions, which are a pain. Anyways, I'm developing a better grasp of regex now. </p>
								<p>Shortly after I finished, I heard the girls next to my room scream. 5 minutes later, Matt taps on my door, which I opened and saw my RA Patrick handling this massive bug. He stuck it into a water bottle and gave it to me. Why? I have an Insect Observation Project due Wednesday for my Insects and Human Society class. So, I gathered my laptop and other electronics and moved into the laundry room to do my observation. No way was I going to keep this big fat bug in my room! </p>
								<p> My field notes for the bug were pretty terrible and so were my drawings. But, about an hour later, Brandon joins me in the laundry room and we started talking about our high school relationships. Three other people, Matt, Eric, and Patrick, also joined in and we continued this conversation in Matt's room and later my room until 4am in the morning. </p>
								<p> That evening, Roger told me that he met my amazing friend Natalie at an orchestra concert. I haven't talked to Natalie in a while, she seemed super busy with all the things that were going on. Harvard, ya know. She was surprised to learn that I now had a website. Hopefully you're seeing this! Anyways, she made me miss her and all my friends who were far far away. I hope to talk to them soon. =D </p>

								<p> Of all the weekdays, at least for this semester, Friday is my favorite. Since my classes start at 12pm on Fridays, I'm able to sleep in, not attend a class about insects, not take a math quiz, and eat a nice unhurried lunch at Crossroads. Some of my peers won't agree with my last statement, but I'll say, <i> today's catfish was gooood. </i> </p>
								<p> Math lecture today was taught by another GSI. I learned today that Professor Graunbaum missed the past week because of a leg injury. For this lecture, the GSI introduced pretty cool real world applications of linear algebra. But, after that, I kinda zoned out - I couldn't really understand his writing or his lecturing. Instead, I continued to finish the math hw for the current section, continuing on my plan to be a day ahead of lecture instead of playing catch-up each time. It really helps - before going to discussion, I already have a basic understanding of the section and, thus, the discussion reinforces the knowledge I gained from reading ahead. </p>
								<p> By far, the most interesting part of my day was visiting an EECS lab with my friend Daniel Pok. He introduced me to a graduate student, Victor, who led us into his lab. In the lab, a behemouth $100k full motion driving simulator stood in the center, along with other humanoid robots off to the side. Victor explained that the simulator is going to be used for observing how people perform under duress, drunkeness, etc. For now, though, he says that they installed <i> Need for Speed </i> on the simulator. I watched Daniel use the simulator first and, from my vantage point, every time he crashed, the simulator jerked up and down and side to side. After another person used the simulator, I got to play! Compared to the previous drivers, I chose to drive more cautiously around curves. It felt extremely smooth when around banks the chair rotated around the center. And, surprisingly, when I crashed, the jerk, yaw, and rotation wasn't as sharp as it looked from the outside. When my car finally came to a halt, due to the extensive damage to my car, I was on my second lap, the only one in the group to do so. =D It was definitely an epic ending to a long long week! K. I'm exhausted.</p>

								<p> So, Jessica was right. I ended arriving to my CS61B lab 20 minutes late. So much for a 10am! </p>
								<p> Yet, despite my inability to finish the CS61B lab during the session - oh, and the fact that I forgot to do my CWR4B hw - I feel much better than yesterday. Perhaps, it was the Korean restaurant in the Northside Asian Ghetto that I ate at for the first time -- definitely coming back. More likely though, it was because I heeded all the Reddit advice Kenny sent me yesterday. In particular, I realized that I needed more confidence... not arrogance, but <i>confidence</i>. </p>
								<p> I discovered today that finding a book in a huge library is extremely complicated. After obtaining the address of the book, <i>Iranian Hostage: A Personal Diary of 444 Days in Captivity </i>, (it was the subject I chose for the social change research project!), which was E183.8I55S54 1984, I had to locate section E, which I found out after making a round around the library was on Floor C. After that and another round around the library this time on Floor C, I located section E. Shelf I55 was deep within section E and, actually, was quite hard to find. The story gets worse: the books on the bookshelf aren't really organized well -- S54 doesn't really give you anything. I wounded up just choosing a random part of the long bookshelf.. and <i> viola</i> my book was there. I also picked up other books.. but yea.. long story.</p>
								<p>I also had an Enactus meeting today. I had never really intended to join the club. On the day of their first meeting, I was looking for a different club, Berkeley Consulting Club. They were having a meeting in 106 Moffit and I saw two girls, Cassie and Alicia, in suits exiting from a nearby classroom. Being 30 minutes late, I assumed that they were from the Berkeley Consulting Club. After asking if <i>the meeting</i> was over - they said, "yes" - I asked to put myself on the mailing list. Turns out, they were exiting from 103 Moffit, not 106 Moffit. But, nevertheless, I applied to Enactus, passed the interview, and now I'm in the club. I think it's a promising organization.</p>
								<p>Anyways... that's enough for today. Confidence! C'mon Brian! </p>

								<p> Lately, I realized that I needed a forum to <s>rant</s>... nah, <i>churn</i> out some thoughts and ideas. Perhaps, it would also be good to have a journal 		of the events that happen throughout college - it'd be interesting to look back on my successes, failures, interesting happenings, and what-nots. At this 		point, I'll admit that my writing lacks the eloquence of writers such as Tim O'Brien and Joseph Heller. Even so, I doubt my life would resemble a James 		Bond, or Jason Bourne, action movie. (I like both.) So, excuse my cacophonic writing. Please. </p>

									<p> For the past few days, I've been troubled by two problems. The first lies in academics. It appears that my many attempts to conquer my important classes, namely Math 54 and CS61B, have been futile. In Math 54, I flunked the first midterm. Turns out studying from the past midterms was a mistake - the questions on the actual midterm were more difficult and more comprehensive. To address this, I resolved to writing down the problems on the homework such that reviewing the homework is effortless. So far, it appears to be working, although I did miss a question on the quiz today. I incorrectly made an assumption that a matrix was supposed to be diagonalizable, and, thus, my proof was too narrow. As for CS61B, I'm falling behind - got a lot of catchup to do. </p>

									<p>My second problem lies with my social abilities. Recently, I have been failing to muster the energy to engage in a meaningful conversation. Yesterday, my friend Kenny remarked after observing me with some floormates at Crossroads that I barely spoke a word. Today, I felt invisible as I passed by a floormate without any acknowledgement. I need to figure out how to make a nonacademic conversation, but Kenny warns that I might be too calculated in this approach. I need to experiment, be spontaneous, and take risks. Undoubtedly, this will be one of my biggest challenges in college. </p>

									<p>Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed my honesty in this <i>blog?</i> Is that what you call it? Many have viewed me as an infallible and ultra-smart student. In reality, I feel like I'm being torn to shreds at this point. Maybe writing this will alleviate things. At the very least, I can keep track of my progress. In other news, I'm still playing around with a newly acquired Raspberry Pi and, today, I had an interesting lecture by Professor Schruben in my IEOR seminar. He talked about how operations research was applied during his time in the military during the Vietnam War and also in other companies he worked for. Fascinating. Anyways, I'm putting up some nice images from Reddit on the front page. People are thinking that my placeholder images are bugs. They're not. </p>
