          <h1 class="blogtitle">My First 10 Weeks at Cal</h1>
          <hr>
          <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Posted on October 30, 2013</p>

          <p> I'm nearing the end of my first 10 weeks of my freshman year. With that, I'd like to reflect upon what's working, what's not working, and what I think I should do in the next 8 weeks of my first semester. </p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Academics</li>
				<p> To be honest, my grades right now are satisfactory. I'm doing well in my Computer Science class, performing above average on tests and projects. However, I feel overloaded from that one single class. The amount of time I devote to CS61B detracts from the amount of time I'm able to put forth into my other classes. As such, a see-saw effect occurs - when I spend more time on Hilfinger's class, I neglect some of the assignments for my other classes. My performance in Math 54 is not too shabby right now. Taking the effort to write the problems on my homework assignments allows me to use it to easily study for the quiz. Though I've been making several careless errors on each quiz, I feel like I'm having a better understanding of the class now compared to the weeks before the first midterm. For my CWR4B class, I have a paper that I'm having trouble with due on thursday. I need to refocus my argument as my thesis doesn't match my body paragraphs and vice-versa. It's a tough business - I've been meeting my professor for assistance. As for my insects class, I've been neglecting it completely. Fortunately, there aren't any assignments fo rthat course. And, for my IEOR seminar, the situation is similar. Although, I've lost a few notes from a computer crash about two weeks ago because of my Ubuntu installation. Hopefully, that doesn't hurt my grade too much. </p>
				<li>Personal Health</li>
				<p>I'll admit I haven't been taking good care of myself up until this point. The stress caused by my CS61B project and midterm several weeks ago has resulted in a upper respiratory infection, or a cold. I need to resume eating breakfast, salads, and fruits and, also, exercising. I really need to start hitting the gym. </p>
				<li>Extracurriculars</li>
				<p>My main extracurricular activity at the moment is PiE. Enactus hasn't been doing much, so I don't know what's going on right there. My assignment for PiE remains the same, to convert a byte array into something more meaningful - a dictionary. I haven't been to any more Hackathons after my first one hosted by H@B. I need to start resuming those. Also, I should start attending more company info/worksessions and getting myself out there. </p>
				<li>Social Life</li>
				<p>My friend group has basically solidified into two groups: my upperclassmen (mostly sophomore) friends and my fellow freshman friends, mostly floormates. I'm pretty satisfied with my primary friends group at the moment, they've provided the enthusiam, support, and comradarie during the difficult times. I'm grateful for that. I haven't been to many social events after my first day here, but, I'm fine with that. Academics are the priority, right? </p>
				<li>Girls</li>
				<p>Ahh.. the section you've been looking for. Nope, nothing major happened in this department. </p>
				<li>Life Hacks</li>
				<p>I'm going to start scheduling my daily activities in a calendar and hope that I can hack my life so that I can be more efficient. I've tried it in the past, but I always renege on it. Hopefully, I'll stick to it this time. </p>
				<li>Personal Projects</li>
				<p> I really want to do a "one project a week" type of thing. Right now, I don't have time. Hilfinger's eating up my seconds of the day. Not good. Gotta start soon. </p></ul></p>
