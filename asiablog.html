          <p>I really enjoyed my 3-week trip all around Asia. I saw many familiar and unfamiliar faces, explored many places, and definitely had one of the most memorable adventures ever. There's several things that stuck out on this trip that truly define my experiences so here they are:
          <ol>
          	<li>After just a few hours of traveling, you can be in an entirely differently environment where people have different customs and speak a completely different language.</li>
          	<li>Japan had the fanciest and most advanced bathrooms I have ever seen. Chinese squatting toilets speak for themselves. Indonesian toilets have sprays next to them to spray clean. Getting used to the various toilets was a "culture shock."</li>
          	<li>I can talk well with people of my generation.</li>
          	<li>Traveling alone isn't fun. I should bring someone else. </li>
          	</ol>
          	I'll add more as they come to me.

          <p>At Jakarta airport waiting for Cathay 798 for Hong Kong right now. Haven't written in over a week. Here's a recap, to the best of my ability, of my experiences in Indonesia.</p>
          <p>
          <ul>
          	<li>January 9</li>
          	<p>In the morning, I, along with my two grandparents, departed for Guilin LiangJiang Airport in the morning for a 10am flight. After eating Guilin mifen (rice noodles), we left in an arranged taxi that would take us to the airport for 60 yuan. Turns out that the taxi driver wanted to add another passenger, so we panicked when the taxi driver drove us in the direction opposite of the airport and to a spot where other taxi drivers dropped off passengers for their colleague to take to the airport. 30 minutes were wasted because of this and we feared that we were going to miss our flight. However, we ended up arriving at the airport an hour before boarding time. My grandparents were hasseled by the airport employees manning the checkin counters because we weren't transferring directly onto our Surabaya flight following our Guilin to Kuala Lumpur flight, so they thought that, because they are PRC citizens, that they needed a visa. Other than that, checkin was a breeze. Afterwards, I cleared immigration smoothly, but, once again, Chinese customs officials questioned my grandparents on the same issue, only letting them go after about 30 minutes once they discovered that my grandparents held green cards. We boarded the plane soon after, one of the last to do so. The flight was operated by an A320-200 and was about 50-75% full. All the red seats, those with slightly more legroom were pretty much empty. I finally got to use my English again when I spoke to the flight attendants to use the restroom before takeoff. Anyways, the rest of the flight was a breeze. Three hours later, I was in Kuala Lumpur LCC terminal.</p>
          	<p>It was hot and humid when I landed. After deplaning via air stairs, we walked quite a distance to the arrivals area. Before clearing Immigration and Customs, my grandparents had to obtain a transit visa to clear customs to transfer to the next flight. Then I had to line up in the lengthy customs line. The whole process took at least an hour. We exited the arrivals area after - my grandparents sneaked past the security checks. It appears that Malay security focus mostly on what's in front of them. Before we checked in to the next flight, I decided to get some food, as Air Asia doesn't serve complementary food and beverages, ending up getting a Hong Kong styled chicken noodle soup. Although the bowl was huge, the food only occupied a very small portion of the dish. It felt like a ripoff. Anyways, I tried to use the self check-in kiosks Air Asia uses. Somehow I couldn't print out the baggage tags, so I had to go to the check-in counter to do that. Then I was told that I had to clear my baggage through security - my grandparents had managed to sneak past Malay security again. This time, however, my baggage didn't get a security clearance sticker. After doing all that, I cleared Malay security - they opened my bag and my grandpa's. My grandma managed to sneak away even though the officer told her to open her bag. My grandpa says that they opened his bag and mine because I took too long to take my belongings. Seems plausible. Anyways, we headed downstairs to a very crowded departure lounge. Outside of the airport, a rainstorm had occured, making the tarmac all wet. When our flight was called, we lined up and then walked the long path alongside the tarmac to the boarding gate. The flight was operated by an Airbus A320-200, fitted with sharktip winglets. The crew were all male. In the cockpit, there was an Australian captain with two first/second officers. We left on time and outside the window I could see the sun setting. Two hours later, we landed in Surabaya. We purchased 3 Visa on Arrival and then cleared customs. The Indonesian official was this gruff military man, who said in a thick voice, "So, you're American, eh?" Anyways, after retrieving my baggage from the carousel, my uncle picked us up. After a quick Chinese meal, we went to his residence.</p>
          	<li>January 10</li>
          	<p>I woke up at around 8-9am. Today was pretty much a chill day. I stayed home and surfed the internet.</p>
          	<li>January 11</li>
          	<p>Today I flew on Garuda Indonesia Flight 338, operated by a Bombardier CRJ-1000NJ to Denpasar, Bali from Surabaya. We were bussed to the aircraft, which we boarded via the aircraft's stairs. The crew was very professional throughout the flight. My uncle and I sat in the emergency exit row seats, which were spacious. The flight departed and landed on time. At Denpasar airport, we were picked up by a driver, who took us to Bali's tourist attractions. First, we visited this lake on a mountain, Pura Ulun Danu Bratan. Small temples were dispersed among the lake shores. My uncle and I rode a speed boat around the lake. At first, only wind blew in our faces. But, a rainstorm was occuring in the opposite end of the lake. As we sped through the waters, water blasted us in the face. Anyways, after many pictures, we left Pura Ulun Danu Bratan, in a rainstorm. We grabbed some Indonesian food at a small restaurant alongside the narrow highway, then proceeded to Tanah Lot. It was raining when we were there, so we just took a quick couple of pictures and then proceeded to the last attraction, Garuda Wisnu Kencana(GWK). The attraction mainly featured a set of pathways carved in limestone and statues of Vishnu and his mount Garuda. After another set of pictures, we departed for the hotel. The hotel, Sofitel, was located in Nusa Dua portion of Bali and was recently built. Part of the hotel had not been even completed. A luxury resort, the hotel borders the Nusa Dua beach and is grand in many fashions. Sounds like I'm publicizing for them. Security guards were everywhere - they even checked our vehicle for explosives. After a quick shower, my uncle and I headed to the Collections, the shopping district, to grab dinner. The next day, we headed to the beach. My uncle hired a boat to take us around the area and back, stopping at a small tourist attraction that housed a variety of animals, which I took pictures with. After this boat ride, my stomach started feeling uncomfortable. I later barfed in the hotel and then the airport, which we headed to after leaving the hotel. Boarding flight GA343 to Surabaya again on a CRJ-1000, though not the same one, I was again in the exit row seats. Smooth flight, nothing much happened. When we arrived back in Surabaya, I decided to rest. That was it. </p>
          	<li>January 12</li>
          	<p>Today, I primarily rested.</p>
          	<li>January 13</li>
          	<p>At noon time, I visited my uncle's paper bag making factory with my grandparents. My mom had wanted me to learn about how my uncle manages his workers. In reality, he manages only 6 people, who manage 20 workers individually. The things he does, he says, are specific and so few would really apply to me.</p>
          	<li>January 14</li>
          	<p>Didn't do much today.</p>
          	<li>January 15</li>
          	<p>Today, I left Surabaya with my grandparents on a 8-hour train ride to Tasikmalaya. During the ride, if I wasn't sleeping, I was awake looking out the window. I didn't want to take my computer out in front of everyone else. At Tasik, my grandma's brother's son's wife and her daughter picked us up and took us to their house. In the evening, many of my mom's relatives came to eat in a Chinese restaurant.</p>
          	<li>January 16</li>
          	<p>Today, I visited my relatives' shops, factories, and homes. In the morning, we visited A Zhong, my uncle's chopstick and some nut factory and later his land on a mountain. On the mountain, he's carving the wood to make chopsticks. Then we visited several other relatives of my grandma. That was pretty much the entire day.</p>
          	<li>January 17-18</li>
          	<p>After eating breakfast, I left for Jakarta via car at around 11am. We, my uncle and my grandparents, arrived at Jakarta airport at about 8pm. My grandparents then left to visit her friends in Jakarta while my uncle and I boarded Cathay 798 to Hong Kong. We arrived in Hong Kong at 6am, where we waited for a 7am bus to head into the city. We headed to my Gu Po (my grandpa's sister) house, where we enjoyed a bowl of ramen and then dropped off our luggage there. My uncle and I then boarded Hong Kong's MTR to FuTianKou, the border crossing between Hong Kong and mainland China. The process was quick, and soon we were in mainland China. Last time I entered China, it was 2 weeks ago and still 2013. Now, I can say I entered China in 2014. Anyways, we boarded Shenzhen's subway and headed to Window of the World (SiJieZiChuan). Although I had already been to the Shanghai World Expo 2010, I found the little exhibits to be pretty neat. Afterwards, we ate at a Chinese fast food and headed to the hotel. My uncle overslept by 2 hours, so we rushed to an electronics center to buy some portable battery chargers that my mom wanted. The air inside was filthy; smoke lingered in the air. Anyways, after purchasing the batteries, we headed to LaoJie (Old Road) to take in Shenzhen's night scene. After a quick circle, we returned to the hotel. </p>
          	<li>January 19</li>
          	<p>In the morning, we departed the airport for Lo Wu, the Shenzhen's point of crossing back into Hong Kong. Holy Smokes there were so many people. Once we made it past Chinese immigration and customs, we found the crossing bridge to be flooded with people. Half of the bridge, I'd say it was about half mile long was filled.. FILLED wwith people. After making it past the bridge, which took about an hour and a half, I had to get in a long immigration line into Hong Kong. That also took a while. My uncle had an APEC card and told me that he would wait for me on the other side. When I made it to the other side about 30 to an hour later, I couldn't find him. I circled the bottom floor a couple of times, then ventured upstairs, then back downstairs. An hour and a half later, I found him at the bottom. He should have waited in the long line with me. Anyways, we rode A43 to the airport, after which we transferred to a Hotel Shuttle that took us to Novotel. After dropping our stuff in Novotel, we ate at the food court and then walked to Ngong Ping 360, which we rode the gondolas to the top, Ngong Ping village. Nearby, there was Big Buddha (yes that's the English name), which I ascended to for some pictures. We headed back down after climbing, boarding the MTR to the a station near cable cars that would take us to the peak. When we arrived at the cable car line, we saw that there was so many people that it would take at least 2 hours and 30 minutes, based on the sign. So, we decided to hire a taxi to take us to the top. Hong Kong's Victoria Harbor was quite beautiful. After a brief look, we boarded a small bus to the ferry terminals, where we boarded a ferry to the other side of the harbor to watch the Symphony of Lights. To be honest, it wasn't that exciting. Just some lasers shooting around the place. We left afterwards to Gu Po's residence, where we again ate bowls of ramen. Then, we headed back to the hotel.</p>
          	<li>January 20</li>
          	<p>Time to head back. We left Novotel for the airport at around noon. I checked in - the counters were operated by Dragonair employees. Then, I crossed immigraion. I sat down, watching planes land for an hour and half and also an Asiana A330 arrive and then depart for Seoul. I also grabbed some lunch, Beef Rice Noodles (I think that's the English name). Then, I boarded JAL 26, operated by a Boeing 777-300ER to Tokyo Haneda. The flight was uneventful. I sat right in front of the lavatories - it was actually alright since there was only one person sitting left of me (I had a window seat), instead of the usual 2, an elderly lady. She needed my assistance with the seat trays and IFE remote, which I was glad to help. After arriving in Tokyo, I tried to find something to eat, ending up settling on a bowl of Udon for 800 Yen, or about 8 bucks. ($1 = 102 Yen) Then, I boarded JAL 2, operated by a Boeing 787-800, to San Francisco. I didn't really feel that much of a difference on the Dreamliner as compared to other aircraft, although the engine did have a distinct whine. I couldn't tell if it was quieter or not. The legroom was ok, being next to the lavatory again meant that I can lean my seat back without worrying about the person behind me. This time, I sat next to a Japanese middle-aged man - he seemed quite annoyed by me. I accidentally woke him up when I realized I forgot to close the overhead bins during the middle of the flight. Anyways, the flight crew on both flights were pleasant. On Jal 2, the flight attendant that served my section kept on thinking I was Japanese and spoke to me in Japanese even though I always responded with English. Anyways, my flight arrived a little bit early. My parents weren't there to pick me up, so I rode BART home. And so that's my Asia trip!</p>

          	<ul>
          		<li>Dec 30 - 31: Ri Xi</li>
          		<p>I visited my father's village with a "Gu Gu" (She is actually my late grandpa's brother's daughter) and her two sons and a daughter. The village, or, at least my father's part, has been greatly improved. The ground surrounding the houses have been paved with cement and are very clean, no longer littered with animal droppings and other gross stuff. The livestock are now located in the back, cordoned off by a newly erected cement wall that encapsulates the village's houses. A bathroom has been added and that includes a shower, albeit quite small. As for the homes, the windows and doors have been replaced with newer ones, new furniture has been moved in, and the walls are now made up of smooth concrete. Overall, it's a vast improvement since I last visited. </p>
          		<p>I enjoyed my stay in my "Lao Jia" (Old Home), mainly because of the fun I had when interacting with the children. I taught a little boy how to high-five and fist bump, which was pretty cute. I talked with the eldest of the two sons mentioned earlier about America and airplanes, sometimes using his broken English. I want to show him places outside of Hainan in the future. His mother's younger sister, another "Gu Gu" whom I met several times, also showed up. And, the Shu Shu who still lives in the family village with his family showed me around the local town and my late grandfather's paddy. Overall, it was a pleasant experience, aside from the cold I received from sleeping there. </p>
          		</p>
          		<li>Dec 31: Haikou</li>
          		<p>I returned to Haikou in the afternoon and I didn't really do much. I checked my emails and found that I was waitlisted to PennApps... bummer. In the evening, I went with Shen Shen and Jia Jia to a restaurant where I feasted on a hot pot and la mian. Afterwards, we took a walk in a nearby sports complex and then found a theater to watch Police Story 2013, passing the New Year while watching the movie. I enjoyed the movie - the dark tone of the movie provided a suspenseful atmosphere to the sudden storyline changes. But, I really hated how people talked so loudly during the movie, that included Jia Jia. People even answered their phones during the movie, which was quite annoying. Anyways, 2014!</p>
          		<li>Jan 1: Fishing</li>
          		<p>Today, my Shu Shu, Shen Shen, Jia Jia, their family friends, and I went to a local park to have fun. "The Men" - family friend's dad, Shu Shu, and I went fishing, while the others interacted with the animals. At first, we were getting no action. Nothing was biting. I had hoped that we would catch something, every time I went fishing I came up empty. We then switched locations along the pond and, soon, Shu Shu caught the first fish, a rather big one. Then, I caught my first ever fish. Then another. Another. Afterwards, the fish stopped feeding for a while, but, about an hour later, fish started biting like crazy. Soon, everyone fishing on the pond had pretty much came over to our side of the pond, seeing how many fish we caught. At this point, we were throwing more fish back in then other people were catching at all. In total, I caught about 8 fish by the time we had called quits. I'd say I'm at fishing level 3.</p>
          		<p>In the evening, after a chicken soup hot pot meal, Shu Shu, Jia Jia, and I visited Bo Bo's house. There, Bo Bo told me how my father was so studious that, despite the fact that he was coming from a dirt poor, the poorest of the poor, nong ming (farmer) background, he managed to test above everyone else on the island of Hainan. He told me how my father would study in Bo Bo's house to avoid the loud distractions outside, study even when the government provides a rare free movie to which everyone else attended, buy the shittiest radio possible, which Bo Bo said had so much static it practically didn't work, to tune into an English learning program an hour a day, and much more. My grandfather at the time had no money and had to get a loan for 200 yuan - he paid it back by selling his pigs - to pay for my father's education. Bo Bo was moved to tears when he told me this story. So, my description here does not do my father's efforts any justice. In the end, he was too poor to attend Beijing University and, instead, went to Zhongshan University, which was much closer. My father never told me any of this before - all I had known is that he came from a very poor poor village. He wasn't the one to talk about his past that much. This made me much more respectful of my father and of my education.</p>
          		<li>Jan 2 - 4: Sanya</li>
          		<p>I traveled via high-speed rail to Sanya. There, at the rail station, a coworker of my relative there, Su Yun Kai, picked me up and took me to lunch and then to my hotel. My hotel had nice view of Sanya Beach (SanYaWan). Unfortunately, I was only by myself. Everyone's telling me to get a girlfriend to take along with me next time... In the afternoon, I walked to the beach, which was about 10 minutes away. In the evening, Su Yun Kai took me to the "relative dinner," as I call these now. There was Su Yun Kai, his wife, Su Yun Fu, a "Jie Jie", and another "Ge Ge." Aside from Su Yun Kai's son, we were all the same generation - however, I was the youngest there. I actually felt comfortable there, being a part of the same generation. I managed to engage in the conversations.</p>
          		<p>The next day, Su Yun Kai's coworker took me to NanShan. It basically was a large temple, with a giant green Budda on an island connected by a bridge as the highlight of the park. It's like China's Statue of Liberty. Anyways, at noontime, I returned back to the hotel. I again took the 10 minute walk to the beach, this time bringing my Coding Book. I finished reading the simple overview of topics covered in the interviews and returned to the hotel. At 6, Su Yun Fu took me to Su Yun Kai's insurance company's new year party. At first, it was rather awkward, being just a relative of one of the workers at the company. Su Yun Kai sat me down at a table full of his coworkers and told me to eat there. That felt really awkward. But, when they talked about colleges, I decided to ask the people sitting next to me what they were studying. I actually forgot what they answered, but it gave me an opportunity to talk about how I attend UC Berkeley and am from America, which was my only worthy topic of conversation. We then talked until she, the other didn't talk, had to leave. Well, what do I do? I asked the person sitting on my right what major she was pursuing. I already knew from her conversations with others at the table that she was a junior in college. She responded, "English translation," to which I replied, "So you understand what I'm saying right?" She asked why I had a "different accent." "I'm an American." Well, Su Yun Kai's wife, A Sao (I think that's what you call a brother's wife.) interjects, "you're still a Chinese person!" I'm like, "Come on, if I told everyone I was a Chinese person that'd be pointless." Anyways, we then begin a conversation on life in our respective countries, asking me how we learned English in America and how painful it is to learn English in China. That's totally how I feel about learning Chinese! She complained about having to read a difficult passage that day. Ha ha, I can barely read Chinese passages. We compared housing prices, which every Chinese person living in Hainan seems to like talking about. Also, she asked if I found a girlfriend in America yet. Of course not, but she thinks finding a girlfriend in America is easy. It's not and I'm not desperate. She also thought that Christmas was "our New Year's" in America. A Sao and everyone else at the previous night's dinner thought so too. How foolish! jk. I really enjoyed my conversation with Sophia - she told me that she picked the name out of a book of names on the first day of class. At the end of the company party, A Sao pulled me to another table to have a separate conversation, also to avoid angering off Sophia's boyfriend, which was also the reason why A Sao told me not to give Sophia my contact information. Anyways, A Sao and I had another pleasant conversation on our different backgrounds. She had to use the translator on her phone several times, not a really a problem when you talked to the English translator Sophia. I think much of our conversation had to do with various American holidays. Overall, out of my entire experience in Sanya, I enjoyed the company dinner the most. Back in my hotel, I watched Abduction, which was about a character discovering that his parent's weren't his birth parents and then discovering that he was the son of a special CIA agent that stole an encrypted list of people who have sold state secrets from another dude. With this relevation, he and a girl have to fight bad guys and confront the guy his father stole the information from and his thugs. I found the movie rather entertaining. I also watched a Chinese game show featuring Zhou Jie Lun in which contestants pick a "talent" that demonstrates a gifted mind and perform a challenge picked by themselves. One contestant beat a challenge in which in a large wall of rubic's cube, he had to find the one that was changed. And, this wall was massive. Another one could recognize which piano keys were pressed. Another one could navigate through a laser field blindfolded after a minute's inspection. Another one could look at a face and determine which two faces it had been combined from. It was one of the better game shows I've ever watched, truly changing my definition of intelligence. After that, I slept - I had to wake up at 8am to head back to Haikou.</p>
          		<p>Su Yun Kai picked me up at 8:30 and took me to the rail station. I missed the 9am and ended up taking the 10am, which was slower by 20 minutes. I tried reading my Coding Book throughout the 2 hour and 10 minute ride. Seated next to me was a girl who also had a book. She also was listening to songs, one of them was an English one that I just couldn't figure out its name. I felt like I should have asked her for it, but I stayed mum during the entire ride, aside from asking her to move aside so I could film the scenery. Shen Shen picked me up at the rail station and took me to a rotating restaurant at the top of a hotel. Shu Shu and Jia Jia were already there. Afterwards, we went back to Shu Shu's house to rest until dinner. Dinner was with Gu Gu and several other relatives. Funny thing is, my dad had never told me he had a sister. According to Shu Shu, she's busy all day selling vegetables. I had pretty much forgotten that I had a "real" Gu Gu. Again, my dad doesn't talk about Hainan all that much. </p>
          		<li>Jan 5 - 8: Guilin</li>
          		<p>The next morning, at 6:30am, I left Shu Shu's house for the airport. Security took a long long time - 30 minutes. By the time I made it through and made it to my gate, everyone else had pretty much boarded the plane. Flight was Capital Airlines 5519. We departed about 5 minutes late and arrived at Guilin on time. There, only 4 people got off the plane. Everyone else, I presumed, was flying to Taiyuan, the plane's next stop. At Guilin, Po Po and Ye Ye, actually my Wai Gong, picked me up. Guilin was terribly cold. Immediately, upon arrival, I caught a cold.</p>
          		<p>This cold pretty much defined my entire stay in Guilin. I didn't leave my grandparent's house that much - even as of this writing, Jan 8, I had been struck by a terrible running nose. I ended up using two tissue boxes worth of tissues. On the first day in Guilin, my grandparents tried to take me shopping, which I really didn't see anything worth buying. Until... they took me to Walmart. There, I saw several flanel shirts that were actually pretty decent looking. So I bought them, 5 of them, plus a jacket, and several sweaters. I never thought that I would be buying clothes at Walmart in China. Oh well. The next day, I was pretty much bedridden. I left the house once, but that was when I went out when it was pouring rain. I spent the hours in the house learning how to program Android apps. Right now, I'm learning how to use Fragments. On the last day, my grandparents and I decided to head to Yangshuo to meet the person I contacted over the internet to teach English several years ago. Liu Fei, I call Jiu Jiu, took us there. We walked down Xi Jie, one of the popular streets in Yangshuo, met Gary, and talked until we reached the local elementary school, from which Gary had to pick up his kids. Afterwards, Jiu Jiu, my grandparents, and I drove back to Guilin and had a hot pot dinner in a small restaurant. Then, we went back home. </p>
          		<p>Unfortunately, I didn't venture out much in Guilin, mainly due to the cold. There's no sun here, blocked by the clouds and the smog I believe, and so the coldness is exacerbated. Plus, I'm pretty much traveling alone - my grandparents don't have the ability to keep up with me. And, thus, everyone here, like in Hainan, is saying I should bring a girlfriend next time so that I could have more fun... sigh. Well, off to Indonesia tomorrow!</p>

          <hr>
          <p>After spending 10 hours in Taipei airport, I boarded Eva 707, operated by an A330-200, registration B-16302, to Guangzhou. The waiting area was nearly empty 45 minutes to boarding time and the plane was only half-full once everyone boarded. I ended up sitting in the aisle seat next to an elderly man. The legroom was similar to the Boeing 77W I had flown in on earlier, though, there was the IFE box underneath the chair in front of me. The IFE, on the other hand, did not have a touchscreen display like the one on the 77W. However, while the screen was also smaller, the resolution was much higher and that made the rest of <i>Terminator 2</i> more enjoyable. Soon after takeoff, they served chicken and rice with different spices than one I had on EVA 707. Having eaten a Mocha and a Chocalate Oulong Cake earlier, I wasn't that parcticularly hungry and took my time eating. Other than that, the flight progressed smoothly. The flight attendants were once again nice, pretty, and extremely friendly. Still, I preferred EVA 707's flight attendants better. But, that's my personal preference. And, now, I'm in Guangzhou.</p>
          <p>Going through customs in Guangzhou went pretty well. The customs official that "examined me" was a trainee and had a hard time deciding whether I was the guy in the passport. Granted, my passport photo was taken in 2010, and I had a fresh haircut. But, after a prolonged examination, I was cleared into Guangzhou. I headed to the International to Domestic counter for China Southern Airlines, where I was told that I could only check-in one baggage, not two. My mom had told me to argue with the employee and make a case for two - I had arrived in China on an international flight and should be allowed to use the baggage allowance on the international flight. That policy, according to the employee, only applied to flights on China Southern and its airline partners. EVA was not one of them. Anyways, he had me proceed to the third floor general check-in area for all flights, so that I could deal with the issue. There, I figured I should contact someone. After repeated efforts to get on internet and finding out that I needed a mobile phone to log onto the internet (I didn't realize I should have used my grandpa's mobile phone number for this), I decided to use the calling cards I had in my wallet to call someone. I didn't know how to call America, so I tried calling my uncle first. He didn't pick up for some reason. At this point, I was getting desperate. Then, I realized I could call my grandparents, so I called my grandpa. He picked up and I told him the situation, asking him to contact my mother. He couldn't call me back so I told him I would call him in 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, he told me that my mother hadn't called back, and we did this again. Still, no response. In the end, my grandpa told me to pay the 268 yuan excess baggage fee, which I did, and I headed into the security check area. On the first lane, the screen showed a Windows error, so I lol'ed. After walking through the security gate, I received a patdown. I think she kinda felt me up. But, after throwing my water bottle containing water away and asking what a brick like object in a pharmacy bag was (money), I made my way to my gate. On the way, I bought a huge pack of cigarettes (my dad forced me). I chose to go cheap and bought the cheapest one. Anyways, I arrived at the gate. My aircraft wasn't there, yet. So, I took a walk around the terminal. When I came back, I saw that my aircraft had arrived. Having expected an B733, I was surprised when I saw an A320. Anyways, I was really excited to finish my journey. This was my 29th hour traveling and I was pretty exhausted. Well, I boarded the flight and was greeted by several Chinese flight attendants. I found my seat, 46A, a window seat, and sat down. Luckily, the middle seat next to me was unoccupied. After an on time departure, I stretched my legs into the middle seat's leg space and tried to sleep. I couldn't. 50 minutes later, I was in Haikou, where I was picked up by my uncle.</p>
          <p>In the car ride to my uncle's house, I felt that nothing has really changed much. Aside from a few new high rises, the houses near the streets looked rundown, debris and rocks still littered the streets, the santiation workers were wearing the usual orange vest and bamboo hat and used a straw broom, etc. My uncle still lived in the same place I last visited and it looked pretty much the same. The only difference was that every so often, I could see people using smartphones and slightly newer technology.</p>
          <p>At my uncle's house, I took a shower, feeling dirty after not showering for 30 hours. I took an hour's rest and then we went to a Korean BBQ-esque place. I kinda felt bad for the waiters there, with everyone barking at them. They looked like they were working really hard and it's hard to imagine how much they get paid. </p>
          <p>Anyways, from my experiences so far as described in the previous two paragraphs, I got a reality check on life. Having lived in America for so long, I realized that I was really fortunate to have such a nice environment to grow up in. I guess this reality check will continue as I will visit my father's village and live there later in the day.</p>

          <h1 class="blogtitle">Eva Flight 27 and an Overnight Layover in Taiwan</h1>
          <hr>
          <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Posted on December 29, 2013</p>
          <hr>
          <p>It's 4:43am. (You know... I don't really know why I'm reporting the time. But, might as well.) I'm currently completing my 7th hour of my 10 hour overnight layover in Taipei Taoyuan International Airport. There's literally no one here - I've been sitting in the lounge for my next flight for the past 4 hours. However, I did get some sleep in another waiting area. They had really nice sofas and, with my backpack as a pillow, I slept for about an hour or so. Anyways, for the past several hours, I'd say I was pretty productive. While sitting on a nice and very comfortable chair and watching TV, Cardiff City vs. Sunderland and a World Bandminton Championship match between China and Indonesia, I fixed up my resume and applied to Google's Engineering Practicum Internship and Microsoft Explorers Internship Program. Now, I'm going to improve my website by adding a projects page!</p>
          <p>My flight on Eva 27 was extremely comfortable. The aircraft was a Boeing 777-300ER and, judging by the state of its IFE, it looked like one of the older aircraft in the fleet. Unfortunately, I couldn't get the registration of the aircraft - the jetways blocked the aircraft at SFO and no identification was found on the aircraft safety cards.</p>
          <p>Boarding commenced a little late - by about 10 minutes are so. People queued in front of the entrance of the jetway in zones. As I sat in the back of the plane, I was in Zone 4. Slowly, we trickled into the aircraft and the friendly and - can I say - gorgeous stewardesses welcomed me into the cabin. As other people were still taking their seats and placing their luggage on the overhead racks, there were little aisle jams every so often. My seat was 62A, a window seat on the left side of the aircraft. The legroom was pretty decent - I had decent room to for my legs to stretch.</p>
          <p>Departure commenced shortly after. When the engines were spooling, the aircraft was filled with intense vibrations and a thundering amount of noise. That's the power of the triple seven's engines right there. After pushback, we taxied to runway 28L and at 4:46pm we took off. Again, the immense roar of the engines was a testament to the shockingly powerful engines.</p>
          <p>As the plane climbed, a glowing sunset could be seen on the left - a nice farewell. I explored the IFE selection - not a lot of movies. Those interesting, for me, were <i>The Matrix</i>, <i>Elysium</i>, and <i>Terminator 2</i>. As I was expecting a meal an hour after departure, I chose not to sleep and tried watching <i>The Matrix</i>. I got lost pretty early and gave up on it halfway through. For the meal, I chose chicken with rice and that was pretty good. There was a small sample of fruits, a slice of lemon cake, bread and butter, and some sashimi.</p>
          <p>I tried sleeping after, but, this is where international flights begin to suck. Finding a good sleeping position has always been difficult for me. I constantly adjusted myself, curling up and then stretching as far as I can go. No good. So, I got out my Cracking Coding Interview book and started reading. By the time I decided to stop, I had read up to the first questions for the first coding questions of the book, about 80 pages in total. Now, I decided to sleep, which I managed to sustain for a couple of hours. The moments I sat awake were pretty annoying, for lack of a better word. Time seemed to pass by really slowly. I decided to watch <i>Linsanity</i> and actually watched through the entire 90 minutes. It was meh... </p>
          <p>An hour before descending, they served another meal. I chose porridge over omelette, and I found it pretty satisfying, having not eaten for about 10 hours. Actually, I'm hungry right now, it's 6:35am. I'm a slow blogger. Anyways, included with that meal was some Ro Song (I forgot the English name), more fruits, a pastry, and I forget the rest.</p>
          <p>After descending into lots of clouds, I could see the streets and lights of Taiwan below me. A pretty smooth landing later, I was in Taoyuan's terminal. I didn't really know what to do - so I kept on walking down the terminal hall until I saw a EVA employee holding up a sign that says Transfer -> BR707. I guess that's me. I talked to her, and she forwarded me to another employee, who told me to go upstairs into the departure lounge. I explored the terminal hall a little bit, ending up buying a watch for $50 so I could keep time without pulling out my phone in China. Maybe I got ripped off, although the watch retails for the same amount I purchased in the duty-free shop on Amazon. Next, I found some comfy couches and slept.</p>
          <p> One hour left until the next flight to Guangzhou. I'm hungry - going to try to find something to eat. Pretty dense fog outside. </p>

          <p>It's 3:53pm. I depart San Francisco on Eva Flight 27 to Taipei, arriving at around 10pm Taipei time. From Taoyuan airport, I will fly to Guangzhou, leaving Taipei at 8am. A 10 hour layover in Taiwan! Unfortunately, I can't really go outside - I have too many things to carry and, plus, I might get lost. From Guangzhou, after a 3 hour layover, I fly to Hainan, my final destination.</p>
          <p>To be honest, I'm quite nervous about this trip - I'm flying alone! 2 years ago, I flew alone to New York City, but this trip is completely different. I'll be transferring in far away places and encountering people who speak a tongue I'm less familiar with - though it's a great time to improve my Chinese. I'll have to watch my own back - no one to let me know that I'm being careless with my possessions and letting thieves have a good time. And, I'll have to be the family ambassador - my family hasn't returned back to China in a while.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, that is the part of the trip I look forward to and am most nervous about. Meeting relatives. I'll be living in my father's village for at least a day. The last time I went there: there was no working toilet or shower. Water was fetched from a well. Maybe I'll visit a village in Yangshuo, where I was supposed to teach English several years ago. </p>
          <p>At this point, I don't know what else to say. I have a long journey ahead and I'm pretty confident that I'll make it through - it's just how many mistakes I'll make. Hopefully not a lot. I'll be blogging on this site every leg of my trip, if I have internet access. Obviously the village won't have wifi! But, Taipei does - and that's my next stop. See you there! </p>
