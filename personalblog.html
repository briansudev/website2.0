          	<p> I'd like to say that college has transformed what I think about tests. Perhaps, this only applies to technical classes. On Wednesday, I received my Math 54 midterm back with a score of 78/100. The average was a 66/100 and the standard deviation was 13. I was quite pleased with this result, but a little disappointed that the question I lost 20 points on turned out to be less complicated than I imagined it. Oh well, glad my 14 hours of studying paid off. </p>
			<p> On Thursday, I started proj2 for CS61B. Working with the skeleton code was pretty intutive, besides being clueless on how to parse the inputted text. I was pretty pleased with my efforts after 6 hours of coding. I think it's coming along nicely -- hopefully this wouldn't take 50 hours like the previous project! </p>
			<p> This morning, I calculated that each class session cost me about $40. It was a really rough estimate and the actual number is lower, but I hope this is enough to motivate me to go to class each day starting next week. (Kinda the worst week to start this routine: research paper proposal due Tue, 2 midterms + 1 math quiz on Wed, CWR4B presentation on Thur, proj2 due Fri.) I've heard that once you realized how much each class "costs", you're less likely to miss class. Maybe, this will work! </p>
