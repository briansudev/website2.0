          <h1 class="blogtitle">Three All-Nighters for CS</h1>
          <hr>
          <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Posted on December 12, 2013</p>
          <hr>
          <p> My oh my! The past three weeks. Or the past three days at least. #thestruggleisreal. I pulled three all nighters the past three days working on the last CS project           CS61B. Today, at 7:02am, I submitted my project for the last time. Last CS project this year! It was an incredible journey. </p>
          <p> It was not without challenges though. Working with my friends certainly strained some of my relationships. On the second night, I had code that was outputting text           that was the correct output, but I hadn't comprehensively tested the code yet. It was 3am and I didn't have the willpower to test it, considering that I had worked for         the past seven or eight hours, and also the night before. They ended up taking my code and trying to make it "their own." They didn't test the code. Fortunately, another friend Brandea ended up testing my code and discovered that we had failed all the autograder tests, save for one. Perhaps, that should be an "unfortunately." But, essentially, the guys had copied non-working code instead of testing it. I was really annoyed by them. Brandea stayed up with me to fix the bugs in the code - some were larger than the others. For example, my code at the time was capturing T: P1 P2 P3 in terms of (T): (P1 P2 P3) with the a space after the colon. But, it wasn't capturing T: alone since I was expecting a space after the colon and then something else. Anyways, that was a simple fix since it took a couple of lines. Most bugs involved isolating where it occured and fixing them. I'm internally grateful to Brandea for staying up with me to insert print statements everywhere so I could figure out where the bugs were occuring. Had she not stayed with me, I would have just given up. Hnin also provided a lot of moral support when she woke up at 5am and looked over our shoulder. The other guys, the people who copied my nonworking code, ended up going to sleep at 4. We stayed up until 8 fixing the code and managed to reduce to one bug, which I resolved in the afternoon after writing my IEOR paper and turning that and my ESPM 40 paper. Essentially, in the middle of my three all nighters for my CS project, I had to do two papers for my other classes. What a week! Last night, I finished the last part of the project, the tripfinder program. I stayed up until 7am, 4 hours past my slip hours deadline, so I lost 5/3% percent on my project. Oh well. So glad it's over. I feel like a much more experienced programmer after this project, especially after I managed to make the makefile program to work. </p>
          <p> I'm afraid that I have been straining relationships at this point. I might be leaving no time for other people and other things because of my heavy workload. I think I've quit PiE as well. I don't think I have time for a special someone. That's what I'm a little concerned about at this point. But, in the end, I'm more excited about my upcoming trip to Asia this winter break. I really need that break. I can't wait to fly around the continent and exploring the different niches. It's going to be so awesome! </p>
          <p> I'll post a reflection of my first semester soon. My finals week are next week and I have to do a research paper draft due Friday and also start studying for my other classes, which I haven't started. I'm feeling a little overwhelmed, but knowing I made it through the last three days lets me know that I can survive the next 7. Good night! </p>

          	<p> Well, I'm finally home for Thanksgiving. I haven't blogged in a while and so much has happened in the last week. Or, so I hope. Let's see what I can recall.
          	<ul>
          		<li>BearHack</li>
          		<p> Over the weekend was Hackers @ Berkeley's Fall 2013 BearHack. Over the course of the first day, my team gradually expanded in size. By the end of the Hackathon, our primary members were Can, Cem, Alan, Daniel, Gavin, and I. We ended up developing a hardware hack that unlocked a door. A motor was connected to a door handle and, at request, it would pull the door handle down, thereby unlocking a door. I was responsible for the front-end and back-end portion of the hack. I developed the interface for which a user would login and operate the robot and also the server, written in Python and utilizing the Flask module, to communicate with the motor.</p>
          		<p> By the time the Hackathon ended, I had been there for 27 hours, with only 1 hour of nap. For that nap, I sprawled across the tables on the 6th floor in Soda. When I woke up, I was freezing. Anyways, our hack won the award for the Best First Hack - the "noobie" award. It was an awesome experience, really. </p>
          		<li>BonFire (A nonfire!)</li>
          		<p>On Friday, I met up with Cem and Can at the Greek Theater for the Bonfire tradition, a rally before the Big Game between our team and Stanford's. I had never been in the Greek Theater before, but I discovered that the atmosphere that it creates was truly spectacular. Unfortunately, high winds led firefighters forbid our bonfire. But, they did have some awesome pyros and tried in every way to make up for the lack of the bonfire. I really wished for it, though, as it was quite cold.</p>
          	</ul>
          	Actually, it turns out that nothing much really happened. Today, Colin, Vivian, and Andrew dropped by my house to say hi. Tomorrow, we plan to eat lunch together - hopefully, we can find a restaurant that is open! Alright, g'night. </p>

          	<p> It's 4:30am and Andrew and I are still up. Right now, he's playing League of Legends. I'm blogging. Well, I'm actually going to sleep at this time. Just finished a painful section of math homework. Terrible. The only highlight of today was that it started to rain. For the first five minutes after I stepped outside to head towards my office hours, I embraced it. Fresh air, right? Well, then, I sorta hated it. Clothes cold and uncomfortable, shoes wet, you name it. Anyways, office hours and lab today consisted of helping other people with the Scheme project. I forgot most of it already, much of my time was figuring out how their code differed compared to mine. </p>
          	<p> In CWR4B, Professor Crisp pointed me out for not having turned in a research proposal. She also called me out for other things. It felt like she had a target on my head. Well, I found it amusing. After class, instead of heading back to my dorm in the rain, I decided to wait for my 6pm CS61B discussion in Main Stacks. It was awfully quiet, but I didn't mind. It was only a waiting room. </p>
          	<p> Aside from that, nothing major happened today. I had dinner with Gabe from the 7th floor and we talked about the hackathon and about CS in general. I watched an episode of Big Bang Theory. Also, Alyson commented about how loud I was. I didn't believe it at first, but, later that night, I cursed loudly as I was leaving my dorm when I realized my shower stuff was in a stall being used and she was in the hallway. Well, I guess she was right. K, I'm off to sleep now. </p>

          	<p> It's been over a week since I have last written a blog entry about what has happened in my life. A lot has happened. Off the bat:
          	<ul>
          		<li>CS Midterm (That was pretty difficult.)</li>
          		<li>CS Project 2 (Took less than the previous project, excluding the futile attempts to make a GUI for extra credit.)</li>
          	</ul>
          	Actually, that was about it. Late nights on CS - that sounds like a rather miserable week actually. I didn't actually think I was that miserable though. Oh, right. I went back home last weekend to go to Costco to order a pair of glasses and bring home some wild alaskan salman marinated in super tasty sauce. So, I did do something!</p>
          	<p>By the way, I hope you guys are all right with this style of writing where I just open the floodgates of my mind. People say it's like reading my thoughts - hopefully, I don't give away nothing too personal.</p>
          	<p>Today, I woke up at 10:30am and starting doing my Math hw. I finished at around 1:40pm and caught my GSI as he was leaving the classroom at 2:00pm to turn it in. Phew! That was close. I attribute this procrastination to my website - it was actually really fun to make. Too much, really, as I continued to build it in my CS61B lecture and after I arrived back to my dorm. For dinner, Brandon, Alyson, Brittany, Matt, Mitchel, Natasha, Larry, Flint, and I (woah, that's a lot of names) went to Crossroads. They had pretty good fish and pork loin. Overall, it was a good dinner. Matt, Manpreet, Natasha, and I went to the APR later in the evening in order to get some free ice cream, but Matt scooped up the last ice cream. =( Anyways, now, I'm catching up on my blogs and website - I need to make a separate page for my projects! </p>

          	<p> I'd like to say that college has transformed what I think about tests. Perhaps, this only applies to technical classes. On Wednesday, I received my Math 54 midterm back with a score of 78/100. The average was a 66/100 and the standard deviation was 13. I was quite pleased with this result, but a little disappointed that the question I lost 20 points on turned out to be less complicated than I imagined it. Oh well, glad my 14 hours of studying paid off. </p>
			<p> On Thursday, I started proj2 for CS61B. Working with the skeleton code was pretty intutive, besides being clueless on how to parse the inputted text. I was pretty pleased with my efforts after 6 hours of coding. I think it's coming along nicely -- hopefully this wouldn't take 50 hours like the previous project! </p>
			<p> This morning, I calculated that each class session cost me about $40. It was a really rough estimate and the actual number is lower, but I hope this is enough to motivate me to go to class each day starting next week. (Kinda the worst week to start this routine: research paper proposal due Tue, 2 midterms + 1 math quiz on Wed, CWR4B presentation on Thur, proj2 due Fri.) I've heard that once you realized how much each class "costs", you're less likely to miss class. Maybe, this will work! </p>
